Module 12 Challenge - nosql Challenge

Using the UK Food Standards sample data, imported .json file using the command line into Mongo into a database named "ukfood_db" and a collection named "establishments".

Further, a restaurant (Penang Flavours) was added to the collection and its BusinessTypeID updated.

All restaurants from Dover were removed from the collection as these restaurants were of no interest.

Additional exploratory analysis was done based on Rating and Hygiene scores and specific geocode locations.
